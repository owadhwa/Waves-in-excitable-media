# Waves-in-excitable-media

This repository explores the formation of "travelling waves" in excitable media. These can be experimentally observed in cardiac arrhythmia. 

Try out the simulation yourself to see the waves!

This simulation is based on the book "An Introduction to the Modelling and Analysis of Complex Systems" which can be found here:
